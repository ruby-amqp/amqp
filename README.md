# About Ruby amqp gem #

[Ruby amqp gem](http://rubyamqp.info) is a widely used, feature-rich, well-maintained asynchronous AMQP 0.9.1 client with batteries included.
This library works with Ruby 1.8.7 (*except for p249*, see the FAQ), Ruby 1.9.2, Ruby 1.9.3, [JRuby](http://jruby.org), [Rubinius](http://rubini.us) as well as [REE](http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com), and is licensed under the [Ruby License](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/LICENSE.txt)

0.8.0 and later versions of amqp gem implement [AMQP 0.9.1](http://bit.ly/amqp-model-explained) (see also [AMQP 0.9.1 spec document](http://bit.ly/amqp091spec)) and support [RabbitMQ extensions to AMQP 0.9.1](http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html).

## I know what AMQP is, how do I get started? ##

See [Getting started with amqp gem](http://bit.ly/getting-started-with-amqp-ruby-gem) and other [documentation guides](http://bit.ly/amqp-gem-docs). We recommend that you read [AMQP 0.9.1 Model Explained](http://bit.ly/amqp-model-explained), too.



## What is AMQP? ##

AMQP is an [open standard for messaging middleware](http://www.amqp.org/confluence/display/AMQP/About+AMQP) that
emphasizes interoperability between different technologies (for example, Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, Node.js, Erlang, C and so on).

Key features of AMQP are very flexible yet simple routing and binary protocol efficiency. AMQP supports many sophisticated features, for example,
message acknowledgements, returning of messages to producer, redelivery of messages that couldn't be processed, load balancing between message consumers and so on.


## What is amqp gem good for? ##

One can use amqp gem to make Ruby applications interoperate with other
applications (both Ruby and not). Complexity and size may vary from
simple work queues to complex multi-stage data processing workflows that involve
dozens or hundreds of applications built with all kinds of technologies.

Specific examples:

 * Events collectors, metrics & analytics applications can aggregate events produced by various applications
   (Web and not) in the company network.

 * A Web application may route messages to a Java app that works
   with SMS delivery gateways.

 * MMO games can use flexible routing AMQP provides to propagate event notifications to players and locations.

 * Price updates from public markets or other sources can be distributed between interested parties, from trading systems to points of sale in a specific geographic region.

 * Content aggregators may update full-text search and geospatial search indexes
   by delegating actual indexing work to other applications over AMQP.

 * Companies may provide streaming/push APIs to their customers, partners
   or just general public.

 * Continuous integration systems can distribute builds between multiple machines with various hardware and software
   configurations using advanced routing features of AMQP.

 * An application that watches updates from a real-time stream (be it markets data
   or Twitter stream) can propagate updates to interested parties, including
   Web applications that display that information in the real time.



## Getting started with Ruby amqp gem ##

### Install RabbitMQ ###

Please refer to the [RabbitMQ installation guide](http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html). Note that for Ubuntu and Debian we strongly advice that you
use [RabbitMQ apt repository](http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian.html#apt) that has recent versions of RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ packages Ubuntu and Debian ship
with are outdated even in recent (10.10) releases. Learn more in the [RabbitMQ versions guide](http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/file/docs/RabbitMQVersions.textile).


### Install the gem ###

On Microsoft Windows 7

    gem install eventmachine --pre
    gem install amqp

On other OSes or [JRuby](http://jruby.org):

    gem install amqp


### "Hello, World" example ###

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    # encoding: utf-8

    require "rubygems"
    # or
    #
    # require "bundler"
    # Bundler.setup
    #
    # if you use Bundler

    require 'amqp'

    EventMachine.run do
      connection = AMQP.connect(:host => '127.0.0.1')
      puts "Connecting to AMQP broker. Running #{AMQP::VERSION} version of the gem..."

      channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
      queue    = channel.queue("amqpgem.examples.hello_world", :auto_delete => true)
      exchange = channel.default_exchange

      queue.subscribe do |payload|
        puts "Received a message: #{payload}. Disconnecting..."

        connection.close {
          EventMachine.stop { exit }
        }
      end

      exchange.publish "Hello, world!", :routing_key => queue.name
    end


[Getting started guide](http://bit.ly/getting-started-with-amqp-ruby-gem) explains this and two more examples in detail,
and is written in a form of a tutorial. See [AMQP Model Explained](http://bit.ly/amqp-model-explained) if you want
to learn more about AMQP principles & concepts.



## Documentation: tutorials, guides & API reference ##

We believe that in order to be a library our users **really** love, we need to care about documentation as much as (or more)
code readability, API beauty and autotomated testing across 5 Ruby implementations on multiple operating systems. We do care
about our [documentation](http://rubyamqp.info): **if you don't find your answer in documentation, we consider it a high severity bug** that you
should [file to us](http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/issues). Or just complain to [@rubyamqp](https://twitter.com/rubyamqp) on Twitter.


### Tutorials ###

[Getting started guide](http://bit.ly/getting-started-with-amqp-ruby-gem) is written as a tutorial that walks you through
3 examples:

 * The "Hello, world" of messaging, 1-to-1 communication
 * Blabbr, a Twitter-like example of broadcasting (1-to-many communication)
 * Weathr, an example of sophisticated routing capabilities AMQP 0.9.1 has to offer (1-to-many or many-to-many communication)

all in under 20 minutes. [AMQP 0.9.1 Protocol Tutorial](http://bit.ly/amqp-model-explained) will introduce you to protocol concepts
in less than 5 minutes.


### Examples ###

You can find many examples (both real-world cases and simple demonstrations) under [examples directory](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/tree/master/examples) in the repository.
Note that those examples are written against version 0.8.0.rc1 and later. 0.6.x and 0.7.x may not support certain AMQP protocol or "DSL syntax" features.

There is also a work-in-progress [Messaging Patterns and Use Cases With AMQP](http://bit.ly/amqp-gem-patterns) documentation guide.


### Documentation guides ###

[Documentation guides](http://rubyamqp.info) (also [on rubydoc.info](http://bit.ly/amqp-gem-docs)) describe the library itself as well as AMQP concepts, usage scenarios, topics like working with exchanges and queues,
error handing & recovery, broker-specific extensions, TLS support, troubleshooting and so on. Most of the documentation is in these guides.


### API reference ###

[API reference](http://bit.ly/mDm1JE) is up on [rubydoc.info](http://rubydoc.info) and is updated daily.



## How to use AMQP gem with Ruby on Rails, Merb, Sinatra and other web frameworks ##

We cover Web application integration for multiple Ruby Web servers in [Connecting to the broker guide](http://bit.ly/kFCVQU).



## Migration from amqp gem 0.6.x and 0.7.x

Upgrading from amqp gem 0.6.x and 0.7.x to to 0.8.0.RCs is straightforward, please see [amqp gem 0.8.0 migration guide](http://bit.ly/amqp-gem-080-migration).
The same guide explains amqp gem versions history and why you would want to upgrade.

## (Very) Short FAQ ##

### So, does amqp gem only work with RabbitMQ? ###

This library is developed and tested primarily with [RabbitMQ](http://rabbitmq.com), although it should be compatible with any
server implementing the [AMQP 0.9.1 spec](http://bit.ly/hw2ELX). For AMQP 0.8 brokers, use amqp gem version 0.7.x.

### Why isn't Ruby 1.8.7.-p249 supported? Will it be supported in the future? ###

In order to make code like the following (pseudo-synchronous) work

    conn = AMQP.connect
    ch   = AMQP::Channel.new(conn)

    ex   = ch.default_exchange
    ex.publish(some_data)

and not be affected by this [Ruby 1.8.7-p249-specific bug (super called outside of method)](http://bit.ly/iONBmH), we need to
avoid any inheritance for key amqp gem classes: Channel, Queue, Exchange, Consumer. This will take a significant refactoring effort and
we do not expect this to change at this time.


### How does amqp gem relate to amq-client gem, amq-protocol and libraries like bunny? ###
