h1. About amqp gem "!http://travis-ci.org/ruby-amqp/amqp.png!":http://travis-ci.org/ruby-amqp/amqp

amqp gem is a widely used, feature-rich, well-maintained asynchronous AMQP 0.9.1 client with batteries included.
This library works with Ruby 1.8.7 (p174 and p334), Ruby 1.9.2, "JRuby":http://jruby.org (highly recommended to Microsoft Windows users), REE and Rubinius, and is
licensed under the "Ruby License":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/LICENSE.txt.

Versions 0.8.0 and later of amqp gem implement "AMQP 0.9.1":http://bit.ly/hw2ELX and supports "RabbitMQ extensions to AMQP 0.9.1":http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html.


h2. I know what AMQP is, how do I get started?

See "Getting started with amqp gem":http://bit.ly/getting-started-with-amqp-ruby-gem and other "documentation guides":http://bit.ly/amqp-gem-docs.



h2. What is AMQP?

AMQP is an "open standard for messaging middleware":http://www.amqp.org/confluence/display/AMQP/About+AMQP that
emphasizes interoperability between different technologies (for example, Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, Node.js, C and so on).

Key features of AMQP are very flexible yet simple routing and binary protocol efficiency. AMQP supports many sophisticated features, for example,
message acknowledgements, returning messages to producer, delivery confirmation, flow control and so on.


h2. What is amqp gem good for?

One can use amqp gem to make Ruby applications interoperate with other
applications (both Ruby and not). Complexity and size may vary from
simple work queues to complex multi-stage data processing workflows that involve
dozens or hundreds of applications built with all kinds of technologies.

Specific examples:

 * A Web application may route messages to a Java app that works
   with SMS delivery gateways.

 * Periodically run (Cron-driven) application may notify other systems that
   there are some new results.

 * Content aggregators may update full-text search and geospatial search indexes
   by delegating actual indexing work to other applications over AMQP.

 * Companies may provide "Firehose-like" push APIs to their customers, partners
   or just general public.

 * A new shiny Ruby-based system may be integrated with an existing C++-based component
   using AMQP.

 * An application that watches updates from a real-time stream (be it markets data
   or Twitter stream) can propagate updates to interested parties, including
   Web applications that display that information in the real time.



h2(Getting_started_with_amqp_gem). Getting started with amqp gem

h3. Install RabbitMQ

Please refer to "RabbitMQ installation guide":http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html
Note that for Ubuntu and Debian we strongly advice that you use "RabbitMQ apt repository":http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian.html#apt
that has recent versions of RabbitMQ. Learn more in {file:docs/RabbitMQVersions.textile RabbitMQ versions} section.


h3. Install the gem

On Microsoft Windows 7

<pre>
gem install eventmachine --pre
gem install amqp --pre --version "~> 0.8.0.RC12"
</pre>

On other OSes or JRuby:

<pre>
gem install amqp --pre --version "~> 0.8.0.RC12"
</pre>


h3. "Hello, World" example

<pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
# or
#
# require "bundler"
# Bundler.setup
#
# if you use Bundler

require 'amqp'

EventMachine.run do
  connection = AMQP.connect(:host => '127.0.0.1')
  puts "Connected to AMQP broker. Running #{AMQP::VERSION} version of the gem..."

  channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
  queue    = channel.queue("amqpgem.examples.hello_world", :auto_delete => true)
  exchange = channel.direct("")

  queue.subscribe do |payload|
    puts "Received a message: #{payload}. Disconnecting..."

    connection.close {
      EM.stop { exit }
    }
  end

  exchange.publish "Hello, world!", :routing_key => queue.name
end
</code></pre>

"Getting started guide":http://bit.ly/getting-started-with-amqp-ruby-gem explains this and two more examples in detail,
and is written in a form of a tutorial.



h2. Documentation: tutorials, guides & API reference

We believe that in order to be the best Ruby AMQP client out there, we need to care about documentation as much as
code readability, API beauty and autotomated testing across 5 Ruby implementations on 3 operating systems.


h3. Tutorials

"Getting started guide":http://bit.ly/getting-started-with-amqp-ruby-gem is written as a tutorial that walks you through
3 examples: from the "Hello, world" of messaging to many-to-many communication with sophisticated routing. All in under 20 minutes.
Check it out! If something isn't clear, every guide explains how to contact documentation authors.


h3. Examples

You can find many examples (both real-world cases and simple demonstrations)
under "examples directory":https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/tree/master/examples in the repository.
Note that those examples are written against version 0.8.0.rc1 and later. 0.6.x and 0.7.x
may not support certain AMQP protocol or "DSL syntax" features.


h3. Documentation guides

"Documentation guides":http://bit.ly/amqp-gem-docs. describe
the library itself as well as AMQP usage scenarios, topics like routing, error handing & recovery, broker-specific extensions, TLS support and so on.


h3. API reference

"API reference":http://bit.ly/mDm1JE is up on rdoc.info and is updated daily.

*If you don't find your answer in documentation, we consider it a high severity bug* that you should "file to us":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/issues.


h2. How to use AMQP gem with Ruby on Rails, Merb, Sinatra and other web frameworks

We cover this subject for multiple Ruby application servers in "Connecting to the broker guide":http://bit.ly/kFCVQU, take a look and let us know
what wasn't clear.


h2. How does amqp gem relate to amq-client gem, amq-protocol and libraries like bunny?

h2. FAQ

h3. So, does amqp gem only work with RabbitMQ?

This library was tested primarily with "RabbitMQ":http://rabbitmq.com, although it should be compatible with any
server implementing the "AMQP 0.9.1 spec":http://bit.ly/hw2ELX. For AMQP 0.8.0 brokers,
use version 0.7.

h3. Why isn't Ruby 1.8.7.-p249 supported?

Because there is absolutely no way we can both make code like the following (pseudo-synchronous) work

<pre>
<code>
conn = AMQP.connect
ch   = AMQP::Channel.new(conn)

ex   = ch.default_exchange
ex.publish(some_data)
</code>
</pre>

and not be affected by this "Ruby 1.8.7-p249-specific bug (super called outside of method)":http://bit.ly/iONBmH
