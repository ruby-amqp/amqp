# @title Ruby AMQP gem documentation guides

h1. Ruby AMQP gem documentation guides


h2. Covered versions

These guides cover "Ruby amqp gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp *v0.8.0.RC13 and later*.


h2. How documentation is structured. How to read these guides.

We recommend you read documentation guides in the order they are listed. Getting Started guide is written as a tutorial that
describes several typical applications and their problem scope, then provides full code examples and finally breaks them down
into smaller pieces that are explained in detail.

Once you are done with the tutorial, reading other guides in order will gradually explain all of AMQP 0.9.1 features relevant to
application developers, including application design concerns and common practices. At this moment, not all guides are written
but *most of the content is concentrated in just 3-4 guides* that are about 80% finished and provide plenty of examples.

Here is what some of the guide are about:

<dl>
  <dt>{file:docs/GettingStarted.textile Getting Started}</dt>
  <dd>
  Walks you through gem installation and 3 applications that demonstrate what AMQP has to offer. Explains how amqp gem should
  be integrated into rich object-oriented Ruby programs.
  </dd>

  <dt>{file:docs/ConnectingToTheBroker.textile Connecting to the Broker}</dt>
  <dd>
  Connecting to AMQP broker. How to integrate with standalone applications as well as Ruby on Rails, Merb, Sinatra or Rack apps.
  What difference application server (Unicorn, Passenger, Thin, etc) makes. How to handle authentication failures and network
  connectivity issues. Closing AMQP connection gracefully.
  </dd>

  <dt>{file:docs/Queues.textile Working With Queues}</dt>
  <dd>
  What AMQP queues are. How to declare AMQP queues. When and how to use server-named and explicitly named queues. How to subscribe
  for "push" message delivery. What message acknowledgements are. How to access AMQP message metadata. How to fetch ("pull") messages
  from queues on demand. How to bind and unbind a queue to an exchange. How to delete a queue.
  </dd>

  <dt>{file:docs/Exchanges.textile Working With Exchanges}</dt>
  <dd>
  What AMQP exchanges are. Concept of binding. How to declare AMQP exchanges. How different exchange types route messages, when it is common
  to use each one. How to publish messages, especially how to do it reliably. What AMQP transactions are. What are Publisher Confirms.
  How to delete an exchange.
  </dd>

  <dt>{file:docs/PatternsAndUseCases.textile Patterns and Use Cases}</dt>
  <dd>Typical use cases, patterns and routing topologies.</dd>

  <dt>{file:docs/Durability.textile Durability and Message Persistence}</dt>
  <dd>Exchange durability. Queue durability. Message persistence. Performance implications.</dd>

  <dt>{file:docs/ErrorHandling.textile Error Handling and Recovery}</dt>
  <dd>
  Network failures. Connection-level exceptions. Channel-level exceptions. Why error handling is easy but
  recovery is hard. How to survive typical problems. What other tools can help (e.g. HAProxy).
  </dd>

  <dt>{file:docs/RabbitMQVersions.textile RabbitMQ versions}</dt>
  <dd>
  RabbitMQ versions amqp gem supports. Popular Linux distributions and RabbitMQ versions they ship. How to obtain up-to-date official
  packages of RabbitMQ.
  </dd>

  <dt>{file:docs/ConnectionEncryptionWithTLS.textile Using TLS (SSL)}</dt>
  <dd>All things related to TLS-encrypted connections.</dd>
</dl>


When two guides describe the same concept, we make sure to use cross-references, however, only one guide really focuses on it.

h2. Tell us what you think!

Please take a moment and tell us what you think about this guide "on Twitter":http://twitter.com/rubyamqp or "Ruby AMQP mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-amqp:
what was unclear? what wasn't covered? maybe you don't like guide style or grammar and spelling are incorrect? Readers feedback is
key to making documentation better.
