# @title Ruby AMQP gem documentation guides

h1. Ruby AMQP gem documentation guides


h2. Covered versions

These guides cover "Ruby amqp gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp *v0.8.0.RC13 and later*.


h2. Documentation structure and how to read these guides

We recommend that you read the documentation guides in the order that they are listed. The *Getting Started* guide is written as a tutorial that
describes several typical applications and their problem scope, then provides full code examples and finally breaks them down
into smaller pieces that are explained in detail.

Once you are finished with the tutorial, reading the other guides in sequence will gradually explain all of the AMQP 0.9.1 features that are relevant to
application developers, including application design concerns and common practices. At present, some guides are yet to be written
but *most of the content is concentrated in just 3-4 guides* that are about 80% finished and provide plenty of examples.

Here is a summary of guides and their content:
