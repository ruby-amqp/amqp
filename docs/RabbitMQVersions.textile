# @title Ruby AMQP gem: RabbitMQ versions compatibility

h1. Ruby amqp gem and RabbitMQ versions compatibility

h2. About this guide

This guide covers compatibility of the "Ruby amqp gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp with various versions of "RabbitMQ":http://rabbitmq.com messaging broker.



h2. Covered versions

This guide covers "Ruby amqp gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp v0.8.0 and later.



h2. Using recent versions on Debian and Ubuntu

Ubuntu (even 10.10) and Debian both "ship with an old RabbitMQ version":http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/rabbitmq-server,
that only supports AMQP protocol 0.8. Ruby amqp gem 0.8.0 and later *will not work with RabbitMQ versions before 2.0.0*.

We strongly recommend that you use "RabbitMQ apt repository":http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian.html#apt that has recent versions of RabbitMQ.


h3. Chef cookbook for RabbitMQ

There is a "Chef cookbook for RabbitMQ":https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master/rabbitmq that installs recent versions from
the rabbitmq.com apt repository. It also has LWPRs (providers) for managing users and vhosts.


h3. RabbitMQ Puppet module

There is a "RabbitMQ Puppet module":https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-rabbitmq by the Puppet Labs team. It uses .deb packages from
Debian testing and unstable repositories. Note that it has two dependencies:

 * "puppet-stdlib":https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib
 * "puppet-apt":https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-apt



h2. TLS (SSL) support

Note that "before 1.7.0, RabbitMQ did not support TLS":http://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html. In order to have TLS
support, RabbitMQ 1.7.0 requires

 * Erlang/OTP R13B or later
 * Erlang SSL 3.10 or later

and recommends using Erlang R141B that ships with Erlang SSL 4.0.1.
