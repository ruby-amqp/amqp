  # h2. What are AMQP channels
  #
  # To quote {http://bit.ly/hw2ELX AMQP 0.9.1 specification}:
  #
  # AMQP is a multi-channelled protocol. Channels provide a way to multiplex
  # a heavyweight TCP/IP connection into several light weight connections.
  # This makes the protocol more “firewall friendly” since port usage is predictable.
  # It also means that traffic shaping and other network QoS features can be easily employed.
  # Channels are independent of each other and can perform different functions simultaneously
  # with other channels, the available bandwidth being shared between the concurrent activities.
  #
  # h2. Opening a channel
  #
  # *Channels are opened asynchronously*. There are two ways to do it: using a callback or pseudo-synchronous mode.
  #
  # @example Opening a channel with a callback
  #   # this assumes EventMachine reactor is running
  #   AMQP.connect("amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com:5672") do |client|
  #     AMQP::Channel.new(client) do |channel, open_ok|
  #       # when this block is executed, channel is open and ready for use
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # <script src="https://gist.github.com/939480.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>
  #
  # Unless your application needs multiple channels, this approach is recommended. Alternatively,
  # AMQP::Channel can be instantiated without a block. Then returned channel is not immediately open,
  # however, it can be used as if it was a synchronous, blocking method:
  #
  # @example Instantiating a channel that will be open eventually
  #   # this assumes EventMachine reactor is running
  #   AMQP.connect("amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com:5672") do |client|
  #     channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(client)
  #     exchange = channel.default_exchange
  #
  #     # ...
  #   end
  #
  # <script src="https://gist.github.com/939482.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>
  #
  # Even though in the example above channel isn't immediately open, it is safe to declare exchanges using
  # it. Exchange declaration will be delayed until after channel is open. Same applies to queue declaration
  # and other operations on exchanges and queues. Library methods that rely on channel being open will be
  # enqueued and executed in a FIFO manner when broker confirms channel opening.
  # Note, however, that *this "pseudo-synchronous mode" is easy to abuse and introduce race conditions AMQP gem
  # cannot resolve for you*. AMQP is an inherently asynchronous protocol and AMQP gem embraces this fact.
  #
  #
  # h2. Key methods
  #
  # Key methods of Channel class are
  #
  # * {Channel#queue}
  # * {Channel#default_exchange}
  # * {Channel#direct}
  # * {Channel#fanout}
  # * {Channel#topic}
  # * {Channel#close}
  #
  # refer to documentation for those methods for usage examples.
  #
  # Channel provides a number of convenience methods that instantiate queues and exchanges
  # of various types associated with this channel:
  #
  # * {Channel#queue}
  # * {Channel#default_exchange}
  # * {Channel#direct}
  # * {Channel#fanout}
  # * {Channel#topic}
  #
  #
  # h2. Error handling
  #
  # It is possible (and, indeed, recommended) to handle channel-level exceptions by defining an errback using #on_error:
  #
  # @example Queue declaration with incompatible attributes results in a channel-level exception
  #   AMQP.start("amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com:5672") do |connection, open_ok|
  #     AMQP::Channel.new do |channel, open_ok|
  #       puts "Channel ##{channel.id} is now open!"
  #
  #       channel.on_error do |ch, close|
  #         puts "Handling channel-level exception"
  #
  #         connection.close {
  #           EM.stop { exit }
  #         }
  #       end
  #
  #       EventMachine.add_timer(0.4) do
  #         # these two definitions result in a race condition. For sake of this example,
  #         # however, it does not matter. Whatever definition succeeds first, 2nd one will
  #         # cause a channel-level exception (because attributes are not identical)
  #         AMQP::Queue.new(channel, "amqpgem.examples.channel_exception", :auto_delete => true, :durable => false) do |queue|
  #           puts "#{queue.name} is ready to go"
  #         end
  #
  #         AMQP::Queue.new(channel, "amqpgem.examples.channel_exception", :auto_delete => true, :durable => true) do |queue|
  #           puts "#{queue.name} is ready to go"
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # <script src="https://gist.github.com/939490.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>
  #
  # When channel-level exception is indicated by the broker and errback defined using #on_error is run, channel is already
  # closed and all queue and exchange objects associated with this channel are reset. The recommended way to recover from
  # channel-level exceptions is to open a new channel and re-instantiate queues, exchanges and bindings your application
  # needs.
  #
  #
  #
  # h2. Closing a channel
  #
  # Channels are opened when objects is instantiated and closed using {#close} method when application no longer
  # needs it.
  #
  # @example Closing a channel your application no longer needs
  #   # this assumes EventMachine reactor is running
  #   AMQP.connect("amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com:5672") do |client|
  #     AMQP::Channel.new(client) do |channel, open_ok|
  #       channel.close do |close_ok|
  #         # when this block is executed, channel is successfully closed
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
