  # AMQP session represents connection to the broker. Session objects let you define callbacks for
  # various TCP connection lifecycle events, for instance:
  #
  # * Connection is established
  # * Connection has failed
  # * Authentication has failed
  # * Connection is lost (there is a network failure)
  # * AMQP connection is opened
  # * AMQP connection parameters (tuning) are negotiated and accepted by the broker
  # * AMQP connection is properly closed
  #
