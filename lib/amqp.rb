  # Starts EventMachine event loop unless it is already running and connects
  # to AMQP broker using {AMQP.connect}. It is generally a good idea to
  # start EventMachine event loop in a separate thread and use {AMQP.connect}
  # (for Web applications that do not use Thin or Goliath, it is the only option).
  #
  # See {AMQP.connect} for information about arguments this method takes and
  # information about relevant topics such as authentication failure handling.
  #
  # @example Using AMQP.start to connect to AMQP broker, EventMachine loop isn't yet running
  #  AMQP.start do |connection|
  #    # default is to connect to localhost:5672, to root ("/") vhost as guest/guest
  #
  #    # this block never exits unless either AMQP.stop or EM.stop
  #    # is called.

  # h2. Handling authentication failures
  #
  # AMQP 0.9.1 specification dictates that broker closes TCP connection when it detects that authentication
  # has failed. However, broker does exactly the same thing when other connection-level exception occurs
  # so there is no way to guarantee that connection was closed because of authentication failure.
  #
  # Because of that, AMQP gem follows Java client example and hints at _possibility_ of authentication failure.
  # To handle it, pass a callable object (a proc, a lambda, an instance of a class that responds to #call)
  # with :on_possible_authentication_failure option.
  #
  # @note This method assumes that EventMachine even loop is already running. If it is not the case or you are not sure, we recommend you use {AMQP.start} instead.
  #       It takes exactly the same parameters.
  # @return [AMQP::Session]
  # @api public

    AMQP::Session.connect(connection_options_or_string, other_options, &block)
