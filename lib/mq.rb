# The top-level class for building AMQP clients. This class contains several
# convenience methods for working with queues and exchanges. Many calls
# delegate/forward to subclasses, but this is the preferred API. The subclass
# API is subject to change while this high-level API will likely remain
# unchanged as the library evolves. All code examples will be written using
# the MQ API.
#
# Below is a somewhat complex example that demonstrates several capabilities
# of the library. The example starts a clock using a +fanout+ exchange which
# is used for 1 to many communications. Each consumer generates a queue to
# receive messages and do some operation (in this case, print the time).
# One consumer prints messages every second while the second consumer prints
# messages every 2 seconds. After 5 seconds has elapsed, the 1 second
# consumer is deleted.
#
# Of interest is the relationship of EventMachine to the process. All MQ
# operations must occur within the context of an EM.run block. We start
# EventMachine in its own thread with an empty block; all subsequent calls
# to the MQ API add their blocks to the EM.run block. This demonstrates how
# the library could be used to build up and tear down communications outside
# the context of an EventMachine block and/or integrate the library with
# other synchronous operations. See the EventMachine documentation for
# more information.

  # Defines, intializes and returns an Exchange to act as an ingress

  #
  # == Direct
  # A direct exchange is useful for 1:1 communication between a publisher and
  # subscriber. Messages are routed to the queue with a binding that shares
  # the same name as the exchange. Alternately, the messages are routed to
  # the bound queue that shares the same name as the routing key used for
  # defining the exchange. This exchange type does not honor the +:key+ option
  # when defining a new instance with a name. It _will_ honor the +:key+ option
  # if the exchange name is the empty string.
  # Allocating this exchange without a name _or_ with the empty string
  # will use the internal 'amq.direct' exchange.
  #
  # Any published message, regardless of its persistence setting, is thrown
  # away by the exchange when there are no queues bound to it.
  #
  #  # exchange is named 'foo'
  #  exchange = MQ.direct('foo')
  #
  #  # or, the exchange can use the default name (amq.direct) and perform
  #  # routing comparisons using the :key
  #  exchange = MQ.direct("", :key => 'foo')
  #  exchange.publish('some data') # will be delivered to queue bound to 'foo'
  #
  #  queue = MQ.queue('foo')
  #  # can receive data since the queue name and the exchange key match exactly
  #  queue.pop { |data| puts "received data [#{data}]" }
  #
  # == Options
  # * :passive => true | false (default false)
  # If set, the server will not create the exchange if it does not
  # already exist. The client can use this to check whether an exchange
  # exists without modifying  the server state.
  #
  # * :durable => true | false (default false)
  # If set when creating a new exchange, the exchange will be marked as
  # durable.  Durable exchanges remain active when a server restarts.
  # Non-durable exchanges (transient exchanges) are purged if/when a
  # server restarts.
  #
  # A transient exchange (the default) is stored in memory-only. The
  # exchange and all bindings will be lost on a server restart.
  # It makes no sense to publish a persistent message to a transient
  # exchange.
  #
  # Durable exchanges and their bindings are recreated upon a server
  # restart. Any published messages not routed to a bound queue are lost.
  #
  # * :auto_delete => true | false (default false)
  # If set, the exchange is deleted when all queues have finished
  # using it. The server waits for a short period of time before
  # determining the exchange is unused to give time to the client code
  # to bind a queue to it.
  #
  # If the exchange has been previously declared, this option is ignored
  # on subsequent declarations.
  #
  # * :internal => true | false (default false)
  # If set, the exchange may not be used directly by publishers, but
  # only when bound to other exchanges. Internal exchanges are used to
  # construct wiring that is not visible to applications.
  #
  # * :nowait => true | false (default true)
  # If set, the server will not respond to the method. The client should
  # not wait for a reply method.  If the server could not complete the
  # method it will raise a channel or connection exception.
  #
  # == Exceptions
  # Doing any of these activities are illegal and will raise MQ:Error.
  # * redeclare an already-declared exchange to a different type
  # * :passive => true and the exchange does not exist (NOT_FOUND)

  # to a fanout exchange are delivered to queues whose name matches the

  # Defines, intializes and returns an Exchange to act as an ingress
  # point for all published messages.
  #
  # == Topic
  # A topic exchange allows for messages to be published to an exchange
  # tagged with a specific routing key. The Exchange uses the routing key
  # to determine which queues to deliver the message. Wildcard matching
  # is allowed. The topic must be declared using dot notation to separate
  # each subtopic.
  #
  # This is the only exchange type to honor the +key+ hash key for all
  # cases.
  #
  # Any published message, regardless of its persistence setting, is thrown
  # away by the exchange when there are no queues bound to it.
  #
  # As part of the AMQP standard, each server _should_ predeclare a topic
  # exchange called 'amq.topic' (this is not required by the standard).
  # Allocating this exchange without a name _or_ with the empty string
  # will use the internal 'amq.topic' exchange.
  #
  # The classic example is delivering market data. When publishing market
  # data for stocks, we may subdivide the stream based on 2
  # characteristics: nation code and trading symbol. The topic tree for
  # Apple Computer would look like:
  #  'stock.us.aapl'
  # For a foreign stock, it may look like:
  #  'stock.de.dax'
  #
  # When publishing data to the exchange, bound queues subscribing to the
  # exchange indicate which data interests them by passing a routing key
  # for matching against the published routing key.
  #
  #  EM.run do
  #    exch = MQ.topic("stocks")
  #    keys = ['stock.us.aapl', 'stock.de.dax']
  #
  #    EM.add_periodic_timer(1) do # every second
  #      puts
  #      exch.publish(10+rand(10), :routing_key => keys[rand(2)])
  #    end
  #
  #    # match against one dot-separated item
  #    MQ.queue('us stocks').bind(exch, :key => 'stock.us.*').subscribe do |price|
  #      puts "us stock price [#{price}]"
  #    end
  #
  #    # match against multiple dot-separated items
  #    MQ.queue('all stocks').bind(exch, :key => 'stock.#').subscribe do |price|
  #      puts "all stocks: price [#{price}]"
  #    end
  #
  #    # require exact match
  #    MQ.queue('only dax').bind(exch, :key => 'stock.de.dax').subscribe do |price|
  #      puts "dax price [#{price}]"
  #    end
  #  end
  #
  # For matching, the '*' (asterisk) wildcard matches against one
  # dot-separated item only. The '#' wildcard (hash or pound symbol)
  # matches against 0 or more dot-separated items. If none of these
  # symbols are used, the exchange performs a comparison looking for an
  # exact match.
  #
  # == Options
  # * :passive => true | false (default false)

  # TODO: The classic example is ...
  #
  # When publishing data to the exchange, bound queues subscribing to the

  # for matching against the headers in published messages. The
  # form of the matching can be controlled by the 'x-match' argument, which
  # may be 'any' or 'all'. If unspecified (in RabbitMQ at least), it defaults
  # to "all".
  #
  # A value of 'all' for 'x-match' implies that all values must match (i.e.
  # it does an AND of the headers ), while a value of 'any' implies that
  # at least one should match (ie. it does an OR).

  # It makes no sense to publish a persistent message to a transient
  # exchange.
  #
  # Durable exchanges and their bindings are recreated upon a server
  # restart. Any published messages not routed to a bound queue are lost.
  #
  # * :auto_delete => true | false (default false)
  # If set, the exchange is deleted when all queues have finished
  # using it. The server waits for a short period of time before
  # determining the exchange is unused to give time to the client code
  # to bind a queue to it.
  #
  # If the exchange has been previously declared, this option is ignored
  # on subsequent declarations.
  #
  # * :internal => true | false (default false)
  # If set, the exchange may not be used directly by publishers, but
  # only when bound to other exchanges. Internal exchanges are used to
  # construct wiring that is not visible to applications.
  #
  # * :nowait => true | false (default true)
  # If set, the server will not respond to the method. The client should
  # not wait for a reply method.  If the server could not complete the
  # method it will raise a channel or connection exception.
  #
  # == Exceptions
  # Doing any of these activities are illegal and will raise MQ:Error.
  # * redeclare an already-declared exchange to a different type
  # * :passive => true and the exchange does not exist (NOT_FOUND)
  # * using a value other than "any" or "all" for "x-match"

  end

  # Queues store and forward messages.  Queues can be configured in the server
  # or created at runtime.  Queues must be attached to at least one exchange
  # in order to receive messages from publishers.
  #
  # Like an Exchange, queue names starting with 'amq.' are reserved for
  # internal use. Attempts to create queue names in violation of this
  # reservation will raise MQ:Error (ACCESS_REFUSED).
  #
  # It is not supported to create a queue without a name; some string
  # (even the empty string) must be passed in the +name+ parameter.
  #
  # == Options
  # * :passive => true | false (default false)
  # If set, the server will not create the queue if it does not
  # already exist. The client can use this to check whether the queue
  # exists without modifying  the server state.
  #
  # * :durable => true | false (default false)
  # If set when creating a new queue, the queue will be marked as
  # durable.  Durable queues remain active when a server restarts.
  # Non-durable queues (transient queues) are purged if/when a
  # server restarts.  Note that durable queues do not necessarily
  # hold persistent messages, although it does not make sense to
  # send persistent messages to a transient queue (though it is
  # allowed).
  #
  # Again, note the durability property on a queue has no influence on
  # the persistence of published messages. A durable queue containing
  # transient messages will flush those messages on a restart.
  #
  # If the queue has already been declared, any redeclaration will
  # ignore this setting. A queue may only be declared durable the
  # first time when it is created.
  #
  # * :exclusive => true | false (default false)
  # Exclusive queues may only be consumed from by the current connection.
  # Setting the 'exclusive' flag always implies 'auto-delete'. Only a
  # single consumer is allowed to remove messages from this queue.
  #
  # The default is a shared queue. Multiple clients may consume messages
  # from this queue.
  #
  # Attempting to redeclare an already-declared queue as :exclusive => true
  # will raise MQ:Error.
  #
  # * :auto_delete = true | false (default false)
  # If set, the queue is deleted when all consumers have finished
  # using it. Last consumer can be cancelled either explicitly or because
  # its channel is closed. If there was no consumer ever on the queue, it
  # won't be deleted.
  #
  # The server waits for a short period of time before
  # determining the queue is unused to give time to the client code
  # to bind a queue to it.
  #
  # If the queue has been previously declared, this option is ignored
  # on subsequent declarations.
  #
  # Any remaining messages in the queue will be purged when the queue
  # is deleted regardless of the message's persistence setting.
  #
  # * :nowait => true | false (default true)
  # If set, the server will not respond to the method. The client should
  # not wait for a reply method.  If the server could not complete the
  # method it will raise a channel or connection exception.

  # Takes a channel, queue and optional object.
  #
  # The optional object may be a class name, module name or object
  # instance. When given a class or module name, the object is instantiated
  # during this setup. The passed queue is automatically subscribed to so
  # it passes all messages (and their arguments) to the object.
  #
  # Marshalling and unmarshalling the objects is handled internally. This
  # marshalling is subject to the same restrictions as defined in the
  # Marshal[http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Marshal.html] standard
  # library. See that documentation for further reference.
  #
  # When the optional object is not passed, the returned rpc reference is
  # used to send messages and arguments to the queue. See #method_missing
  # which does all of the heavy lifting with the proxy. Some client
  # elsewhere must call this method *with* the optional block so that
  # there is a valid destination. Failure to do so will just enqueue
  # marshalled messages that are never consumed.
