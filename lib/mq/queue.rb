class MQ
  class Queue
    include AMQP

    # Queues store and forward messages.  Queues can be configured in the server
    # or created at runtime.  Queues must be attached to at least one exchange
    # in order to receive messages from publishers.
    #
    # Like an Exchange, queue names starting with 'amq.' are reserved for
    # internal use. Attempts to create queue names in violation of this
    # reservation will raise MQ:Error (ACCESS_REFUSED).
    #
    # When a queue is created without a name, the server will generate a
    # unique name internally (not currently supported in this library).
    #
    # == Options
    # * :passive => true | false (default false)
    # If set, the server will not create the queue if it does not
    # already exist. The client can use this to check whether the queue
    # exists without modifying  the server state.
    #
    # * :durable => true | false (default false)
    # If set when creating a new queue, the queue will be marked as
    # durable.  Durable queues remain active when a server restarts.
    # Non-durable queues (transient queues) are purged if/when a
    # server restarts.  Note that durable queues do not necessarily
    # hold persistent messages, although it does not make sense to
    # send persistent messages to a transient queue (though it is
    # allowed).
    #
    # If the queue has already been declared, any redeclaration will
    # ignore this setting. A queue may only be declared durable the
    # first time when it is created.
    #
    # * :exclusive => true | false (default false)
    # Exclusive queues may only be consumed from by the current connection.
    # Setting the 'exclusive' flag always implies 'auto-delete'. Only a
    # single consumer is allowed to remove messages from this queue.
    #
    # The default is a shared queue. Multiple clients may consume messages
    # from this queue.
    #
    # Attempting to redeclare an already-declared queue as :exclusive => true
    # will raise MQ:Error.
    #
    # * :auto_delete = true | false (default false)
    # If set, the queue is deleted when all consumers have finished
    # using it. Last consumer can be cancelled either explicitly or because
    # its channel is closed. If there was no consumer ever on the queue, it
    # won't be deleted.
    #
    # The server waits for a short period of time before
    # determining the queue is unused to give time to the client code
    # to bind a queue to it.
    #
    # If the queue has been previously declared, this option is ignored
    # on subsequent declarations.
    #
    # * :nowait => true | false (default true)
    # If set, the server will not respond to the method. The client should
    # not wait for a reply method.  If the server could not complete the
    # method it will raise a channel or connection exception.
